# Oh, hello I’m DenDen.

### Materials Engineer... because why not? (i was forced but it's nice)
Yep, I’m supposedly an expert in **Biomaterials**, **Semiconductor Materials**, and **Biomechanics**.  
Oh, and I thought I’d throw in **Computer Science/Engineering** and **Semiconductor Manufacturing & Design** for good measure—because apparently i enjoy juggling too many things at once. ( AKA i wanted to study CS or EE )

## What I'm *Allegedly* Learning (As if I have a choice)
- **Programming Languages**:  
  Because apparently, the more you know, the more confused you get. I’m diving into Assembly (because who needs readable code?), C, C++, C#, RUST (because nothing says fun like memory safety), Python (the “easy” one they say—yeah, right), JAVA (because everyone loves verbose code), and JavaScript (because, obviously, I enjoy pain).

- **MATLAB**:  
  Ah, MATLAB, where I get to spend quality time convincing my computer to solve problems no one care about.

- **Web Development Languages**:  
  Because someone decided HTML and CSS weren’t enough torture, so we added JavaScript to the mix. Oh joy.

- **Computer Architecture**:  
  Basically, it’s like trying to understand how a magician does tricks, but instead of applause, you get bugs and crashes.

- **AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning**:  
  Also known as “LinkedIn's useres Happiness, i mean who doesen't love making ai sh*t based on OpenAI's thing? ” Spoiler:Full-Time homeless is my future job.

## Skills and Expertise
*Coming soon... or whenever I get around to it. Don’t hold your breath.*

---

Always “expanding my knowledge” in the oh-so-exciting intersection of **Materials Engineering** and **Computer Science/Engineering**. Because apparently...I enjoy making my life more complicated.
